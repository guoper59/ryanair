# FR_AUTO_TEST_2017.rev02

Automated booking up to a declined payment On

## Languages

Java(Maven, JUnit) - This is the language I have more experience and it is the platform I am working right now.
I worked also with Ruby with Watir and Parallel, Capibara,
Jasmine and Chai, and I would be very happy to jump and learn Ruby on Rails and RSpec.
I am always happy to learn and grow my skills.
I like also Cucumber more human or more close to the business language always helps.
